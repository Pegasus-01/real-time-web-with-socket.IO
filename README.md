# real-time-web-with-socket.IO

This is a chat app with different pre-created chat rooms made on express.js and socket.IO

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications.
  It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library     for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API.
  
With this app you can chat in real time on 3 different pre-created chatrooms.
